		This is a poisson solver for 2D elliptic or rectangular geometry that uses SuperLU library.

		Sources are stored in
lu_solver.h
lu_solver.cpp

		Example of usage for elliptic geometry is presented in

test_poisson.cpp
Makefile

		
		To make this solver work you should download and compile SuperLU_4.3 
		from http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/
		After that set all the right pathes in the Makefile.
